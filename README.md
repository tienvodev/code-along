## Introduction

The `code-along` repository is designed to store code from tutorials, workshops, and courses. Each project represents hands-on learning experiences and builds upon different technologies and concepts.

## Structure

Projects are organized into separate folders. Each folder may contain:

- A `README.md` with notes or information related to that specific tutorial.
- Source code files, configurations, and any assets required for the project.
